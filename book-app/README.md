# Code Challenge for 8th Light

## Directions

Create an application that allows you to use the Google Books API to search for books, and deploy it somewhere that we can access through a web browser.

## Deliverables

1. Type in a query and display a list of books matching that query.
2. Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing company, as well as a picture of the book.
3. From each list item, you should also be able to navigate to more information about the book, but this information does not necessarily need to appear on a page within your application. In other words, this could link out to an external site with more information about that particular book.
4. Must be deployed

1) Should include testing
2) Version Control History
3) Read Me

Due date: Both components of this step are due by end of day on Wednesday, June 26.
